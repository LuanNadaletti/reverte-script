 * Represents a database query. This is an abstract class that provides common

 *
 * The class provides a constructor to initialize the query with the statement
 * and table name. It also provides a getter method to retrieve the table name
 * associated with the query. The `toString()` method is overridden to return
 * the original statement of the query.
 *
 * This class is intended to be extended by specific query types such as SELECT,
 * INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
 *
 * Instances of this class are immutable once created.
